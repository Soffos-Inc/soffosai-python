The dog is derived from an ancient, extinct wolf,[6][7] and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.[8] The dog was the first species to be domesticated,[9][8] by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago,[7] before the development of agriculture.[1] Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals[10] and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[11]"
