# Soffosai.py
A Python software development kit for using Soffos AI's APIs.

## API Keys
- Create an account at [Soffos platform](https://platform.soffos.ai) or [login](https://platform.soffos.ai/login).
- After loggin in, on the left panel, click [Projects](https://platform.soffos.ai/apps-list).
- Create a new project.
- Click on the key icon in the project you created and you will find the API Keys for that project.
  - An API key will automatically be provided for you on Project creation but you can still create more when your account is no longer on trial.
- Protect this API Key as it will incur charges.
- You can also save your API Key into your environment variables with variable name = SOFFOSAI_API_KEY

## Installation
`pip install soffosai`

## Syntax
- To set your api key:
```
import soffosai
soffosai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```
Put your api_key somewhere safe, off course. 
If you included SOFFOSAI_API_KEY in your environment variables and specified your API key there, you don't need have this code: `soffosai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"`

## SoffosAIService
The SoffosAIService class handles validation and execution of specified endpoint vs payload.

output = service(
    user = "client_id",
    text = "Ludwig van Beethoven (baptised 17 December 1770 â€“ 26 March 1827) was a German composer and pianist. ... After some months of bedridden illness, he died in 1827. Beethoven's works remain mainstays of the classical music repertoire.",

)
print(json.dumps(output, indent=4))
```
